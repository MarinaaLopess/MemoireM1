abstract = {Both statistical and rule-based methods for named entity recognition are quite sensitive to the type of language used in the analysed texts. Former studies have shown for example that it was harder to detect named entities in SMS or microblog messages where words are abridged or changed to lowercase. In this article, we focus on old French texts to evaluate the impact of manual and automatic normalisation before applying five geographical named entity recognition tools, as well as an improved version of one of them, in order to help building maps displaying the locations mentioned in ancient texts. Our results show that manual normalisation leads to better results for all methods and that automatic normalisation performs differently depending on the tool used to extract geographical named entities, but with a significant improvement on most methods.},

abstract = {Our project involves building a platform able to retrieve, map and analyze the occurrences of place names in fictional novels published between 1800 and 1914 and whose action occurs wholly or partly in Paris. We describe a proof of concept using queries made via the TXM textual analysis platform for the extraction of street names. Then, we propose a fully automatic process using the named entity recognition (NER) components of the PERDIDO platform. This paper describes some encouraging initial results obtained by combining NLP approaches (NER methods) with textometric tools for the automated geoparsing of street names.},
